# GeekBrains Final work
## Final verification work

### **Task:**
1. Create a repository on a GitHub;
2. Draw a flowchart of the algorithm;
3. Provide the repository with a formal text description of the solution;
4. Write a program that solves the task;
5. Use version control in working on this small project.

### **Mission:**
Program forms an array of strings whose length is less than or equal to 3 <br/> characters from an existing array of strings. The initial array can be entered <br/> from the keyboard, or set at the start of the algorithm execution. <br/> <br/>*It is not recommended to use collections, it is better to do exclusively with arrays.*

### **Examples:**
* ["hello", "2", "world", ":-)"] &#8594; ["2", ":-)"];
* ["1234", "1567", "-2", "computer science"] &#8594; ["-2"];
* ["Russia", "Denmark", "Kazan"] &#8594; [ ].
